The only remaining problems that we have are:
- The duplicated code lines we have, such as the criterion, logger or
    hyper-parameters that we have to define in each different function (that
    could be different if we wanted).
- The uppercase problems with some variable's names, that must be that way in
    order to understand the code better.
- The name of some variables that do not appear in the english dictionary.
